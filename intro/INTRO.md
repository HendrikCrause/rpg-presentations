# A game idea for tabletop rpg players

I’d like to start with a question:
What is your favorite part about playing tabletop role playing games like dungeons and dragons?

I can’t speak for everyone, but I can name a couple of things that I enjoy about playing D&D, and some reasons that I’ve heard from friends or that I’ve read online.

1. Playing interesting characters:
Want to know what it feels like to be a strong hulking barbarian, exploring the wilderness and killing monsters by swinging his big axe? Or a druid who uses their strong connection with nature to learn magic. 
But what makes some characters interesting isn’t their class, but rather their personality and their relationship with good and evil. Whether you always try to do the right thing and follow all the rules or you want to be a mass-murdering psychopath, there will be a place for you (although I can’t guarantee what you party members will think of your exploits)
Ultimately, the number of combinations you can play within the rules of the game are only limited by your imagination.

2. Solving problems in unexpected ways:
One of the best feelings you can have as a player is when your DM asks “What would you like to do about being locked in this underground cave safe?”, you reply with “I’d like to use this teleportation scroll I found three sessions ago. Also I’m teleporting back to the town instead of back into the dungeon”. Then watch the DM look at you with a blank face as they try to process how to handle you circumventing everything they had prepared for that session. When being presented with a difficult problem, having a place to try out of the box ideas is a great way of stimulating your creativity.

3. Chance and consequences:
Just like in real life, success is not always a given when playing a game. You quite literally just have to roll the dice and hope luck is on your side. A detail that gets lost in most video games is the concept of consequences. Every action you take during the lifetime of your character, whether a success or failure, will have an impact on the future actions they will have access to. Sometimes it will have lasting effects on the direction of your campaign. The local nobleman will be unlikely to hire you to save his kidnapped daughter after you were caught stealing from his house. Having a chance of failure with lasting consequences, often unknown, on the future of your character is what gives meaning to the actions we choose to take.

4. Stories of grand adventures:
Anyone who has ever tried their hands at running a game themselves will probably tell you the joys, and sometimes woes, of the creative work that goes into making a fantastical world for their friends to explore and interact with. Role playing games in its essence is a form of collective storytelling, and the better and more practiced a DM is at telling stories and painting images in the imaginations of their players, the more enjoyable the overall experience will be. Of course this does not exclude the role of the players. Players have to tell their characters’ stories within the limits of the campaign that the DM has made. It is a cooperative endeavor to tell the most epic tale that everyone involved can tell.

5. It’s really a social thing
By far the most common reason I’ve come across that people play D&D, and one of the main reasons I play myself, is to sit around with friends and have a good time. You’ll make friends and enemies, experience loss, and learn to resolve conflicts both within and outside of the group you are in. The joy of every big success is experienced by everyone, and for every failure there is someone to help cheer you on. The social nature of the game is what draws so many toward it, and why so many people frankly get addicted to it.

Obviously there are many more reasons people enjoy tabletop role playing games, but these were the ones that I thought were the most important.

Now what if there was a way of capturing the essence of everything that people enjoy about tabletop games, and move it to an electronic form - where it can be played and enjoyed at times and places when otherwise wouldn’t be possible. Now I know... this is a big ask. But hear me out.

There are several video games that incorporate elements from D&D and similar games, most of them very popular and fun to play. There have also been a couple of games that are officially licenced by Wizards of the Coast (the company that owns the rights to D&D). But one element that almost all of them have in common is that the story of the game is written by the game developers. What I’m hoping to develop is a game where creative dungeon masters are able to create campaigns that players can play through in their own time with their own characters.

This would be similar to services where DM’s sell or distribute written versions of their campaign for others to use in their own groups, except now you won’t need a DM to play it. If you want to, you can create and distribute your own stories too.

Now you may be wondering how this will capture the essence of playing a tabletop game. Honestly I do not believe that this idea will be able to replace in-person playing. It is a social event after all. But I do hope that I’ll be able to incorporate enough elements of the tabletop experience to come as close as possible. That would mean that:

1. Players will be able to create their own characters.
There will need to be a rich character builder where you can pick class, race, proficiencies and stat-block like attributes.

2. Every interaction will need to have multiple options.
Unfortunately it is impossible to capture every possible choice someone can do or say. That being said, there exist many creative people who are able to write several interesting interactions that players will enjoy.

3. Let the dice decide.
What would a D&D inspired game be if it did not show the most iconic part of it? The results of rolling dice. Since we’re playing on a computer, this can obviously be automated, but should in my opinion not be hidden.

4. Storytelling and dungeon designing should be as easy as it can be.
The biggest hurdle that would stop any of this from working, is if no one is willing to write campaigns for the game. Great care should be taken to ensure that DMs and storytellers have as many tools, settings and game elements available to make great experiences for their players.

5. Building a community.
The final challenge is both the most important and most difficult. The reason that tabletop games are so popular is because of a strong and passionate community. Getting a couple of friends to play a multiplayer campaign may be one way of spreading the word. Having a good marketplace for players and story writers to exchange and give feedback will help too. But ultimately what will build a community depends on the people who believe that this game idea is worth developing and decides that they want to contribute.

There is a lot of work that needs to happen, and a lot of details that still have to be decided on. We’re only in the very beginning stages of development. But I believe this is a project worth pursuing, and I’m going to keep developing it.

I started by asking what your favorite part of playing tabletop games were. I’m going to end with another question:
What are the parts you would like to see in a game like this?
